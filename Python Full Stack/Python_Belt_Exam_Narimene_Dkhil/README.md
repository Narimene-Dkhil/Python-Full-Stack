# WishApp - Python Full Stack

The WishApp is a simple web application where users can register, log in, and make wishes. Each wish includes an item and a description. Users can manage their wishes, mark them as granted, and view statistics on the wishes made by all users.

## Features
- User Registration and Login
Users can register by providing a first name, last name, email, password, and password confirmation.
- Login and registration are validated:
    - All required fields must be filled out.
    - Password confirmation must match.
- Flash messages are displayed for any validation errors.

## Dashboard
- The dashboard displays two main tables:
    - Your Wish List: Shows the list of wishes created by the currently logged-in user. Each entry displays:
        - Item name
        - Date added
        - Actions (Remove, Edit, and mark as Granted)
    - Granted Wishes: Shows all wishes that have been marked as granted by any user. Each entry includes:
        - Item name
        - Wisherâ€™s name
        - Date granted
        - Number of likes
    - Users can like any granted wish, except their own.
- Users can edit or remove wishes from their list.

## Adding a Wish
- Users can make a new wish by providing:
    - Item name (at least 3 characters)
    - Description (at least 3 characters)
- The newly created wish appears in the user's wish list on the dashboard.
- Validation ensures both fields are filled out and meet character requirements. Flash messages display errors if validation fails.

## Editing a Wish
- Users can edit existing wishes, with the form pre-filled with current data.
- Validation is applied, ensuring each field contains at least 3 characters.
- Users are redirected to the dashboard upon successful editing or if they cancel the action.

## Stats Page
- The stats page provides the following information:
    - Total wishes granted for all users
    - The number of granted and pending wishes specifically for the currently logged-in user.
