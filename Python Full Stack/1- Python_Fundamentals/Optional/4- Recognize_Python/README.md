# Recognize Python
The goal of this assignment is for you to use your knowledge of programming concepts and identify them in a new language.  There are two code snippets provided below.  One is a list of programming concepts, and the other is some Python code.  In the Python file, `file.py`, write a comment in the same line of the code with the corresponding concept from the `file.txt` file.

Comments can made with either a `#` (single line) or triple set of `"""` (multiline) at the beginning and the end of the comment.  
```
# this is a single line comment
"""
This is
a multiline
comment
"""
```
Below is an example of the expected output. If there is more than one concept that is covered on the same line, add them both.
```
my_new_favorite_language = 'Python' # variable declaration, initialize string
```
Remember to only use what you already know. If you don't know, this is a great opportunity to utilize the 20 min rule and ask a fellow cohort mate. All of these concepts will be explained in the modules to follow.

The files can be downloaded here.

Concept list **[file.txt](https://assets.codingdojo.com/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/file.txt)**
Python code **[file.py](https://assets.codingdojo.com/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/file.py)**

## Requirements:
- Open the files in a text editor
- In file.py, identify the code with a comment to correspond with the concept from file.txt
- Submit the python file with the comments
