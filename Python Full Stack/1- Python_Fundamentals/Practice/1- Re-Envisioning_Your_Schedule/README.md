# Re-Envisioning Your Schedule
**Learning Objective:**

- Create an organized schedule for personal study that minimizes life distractions and leverages your support network
- Expect Python to be a steeper learning curve with a more demanding schedule than Web Fundamentals
- Align your schedule to the workload expectations of the Python stack

## Python versus Web Fundamentals
Many students notice that Python requires more time and effort than Web Fundamentals required. In order to set yourself up for success, it is essential to anticipate the additional challenges of this new programming language, and to plan for them!

With that in mind, **it's time to re-examine your weekly schedule**. Consider whether you'll need to make any accommodations within your calendar in order to stay on pace throughout Python.

1. Begin by either finding your original planner or making a copy of the planner template.
    1. If you're a **full-time** student, make a [copy of this planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DNbvjV_HgDJtPIwAQNRo65N3MnUrLsUMzEUQu8aNtCM/copy).
    2. If you're a **part-time** or **flex** student, make a [copy of this planner](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lUDC3Mvktdcif995EZRYQAnNmGdSf3Hp4dHFEihuZyU/copy).
2. Look at the example tab and think: what sorts of daily and weekly activities would I need to include in my schedule? What can I delegate to someone else until after bootcamp? A great question to help guide your work is "what am I going to give up in my schedule now, so that I can prioritize my learning for tomorrow?"
3. Use the blank template to create your own weekly schedule. Be sure that you set a rigorous - but realistic - daily cadence.
4. Once you've allocated your bootcamp and non-bootcamp time, turn in your schedule below and continue on!
